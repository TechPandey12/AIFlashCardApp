Current Electricity - Class 12 (Basic Notes)

Electric Current

-   Flow of electric charge per unit time.
-   Formula: I = Q / t
-   Unit: Ampere (A).

Ohm’s Law

-   V = IR
-   Resistance (R) opposes current flow.
-   Linear relation between current and voltage.

Resistance

-   Property of a conductor to resist current.
-   Formula: R = ρ (L / A)
    -   ρ = resistivity
    -   L = length of conductor
    -   A = cross-sectional area

Resistivity

-   Material property.
-   Unit: Ωm.
-   Independent of dimensions.

Combination of Resistors

-   Series: R_eq = R1 + R2 + R3 …
-   Parallel: 1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 …

Electric Power

-   P = VI = I^2R = V^2 / R
-   Unit: Watt (W).

Cells and EMF

-   EMF: Potential difference when no current flows.
-   Internal resistance reduces terminal voltage.

Kirchhoff’s Laws

1.  Junction Rule: ΣI(in) = ΣI(out)
2.  Loop Rule: Σ potential difference in a closed loop = 0

Applications

-   Used in circuits, measuring instruments, power transmission, etc.
